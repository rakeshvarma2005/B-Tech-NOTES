# File Upload Fix Summary

## Issue
The B-TECH NOTES application was experiencing issues with file uploads to Supabase storage. The error message was:
```
new row violates row-level security policy
```

This indicates that the application doesn't have the necessary permissions to create storage buckets or upload files.

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved Error Handling in NotesUploadForm.tsx
- Added more detailed error logging and user feedback
- Added validation for file paths and names
- Improved authentication verification before upload attempts
- Used `upsert: true` to handle potential duplicate files

### 2. Enhanced File Upload Utilities in utils.ts
- Added better error handling and logging
- Improved file name sanitization
- Added file size validation
- Added bucket existence checks
- Used `upsert: true` for more reliable uploads

### 3. Enhanced ImageUploader Component
- Added progress indicator for uploads
- Improved error handling and display
- Added file size validation
- Added more detailed error messages for users

### 4. Created Diagnostic Tools
- Added `test-storage.js` script to test Supabase storage functionality
- Provides detailed error information for troubleshooting

### 5. Added Documentation
- Created `STORAGE-SETUP.md` with detailed instructions for fixing storage issues
- Updated `SUPABASE-SETUP.md` to include storage policy setup
- Added SQL script for storage policies in `supabase/migrations/storage_policies.sql`

## How to Fix

1. Follow the instructions in `STORAGE-SETUP.md` to:
   - Create the required storage buckets manually in the Supabase dashboard
   - Set up proper Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for storage
   - Verify your API credentials

2. Run the `test-storage.js` script to verify that storage is working correctly:
   ```
   node test-storage.js
   ```

3. If you're still experiencing issues, check the browser console for detailed error messages and review the Supabase logs in the dashboard.

## Root Cause

The root cause of the issue was missing Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for the storage buckets. By default, Supabase applies strict security policies that prevent operations unless explicitly allowed. The application was trying to create buckets and upload files without the necessary permissions.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always set up proper RLS policies for storage buckets
2. Test storage functionality early in the development process
3. Use the diagnostic tools provided to troubleshoot issues
4. Implement proper error handling and user feedback in the application

# PDF Upload and Display Fix Summary

## Issue Summary
There were issues with uploaded PDF files not appearing in the related semester/subject/unit views after approval. The files were being uploaded correctly to Supabase storage, but weren't being properly filtered and displayed in the NotesBrowser component.

Additionally, there are issues with viewing PDFs due to CORS restrictions and browser PDF viewer compatibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. NotesBrowser Component Fixes
- Added debugging logs in the `fetchNotes` function to track the notes being loaded
- Added logging for year/semester filtering to identify potential filter issues
- Fixed the display of notes by ensuring proper field checking
- Enhanced file type detection to properly display PDFs and handle other file types
- **Added multiple PDF viewing options for maximum compatibility**:
  - Browser native PDF viewer (using object tag)
  - Google Docs PDF viewer (for cross-browser compatibility)
  - Direct download option

### 2. PDFViewer Component Enhancements
- Updated the PDFViewer component to accept a direct URL from Supabase storage
- Added proper error handling for file loading issues
- Added support for different document types and annotations
- Improved the UI for a better viewing experience

### 3. AdminPanel Approval Flow
- Enhanced the approval process to verify the file URL before approving
- Added additional validation to ensure notes have all required fields
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### 4. Database and Storage Fixes
- Created SQL migration scripts to fix existing notes in the database
- Updated missing fields like unit_number, notes_type, and is_important_questions
- Added additional logging to the database functions for better debugging
- **Added storage permission fixes to address CORS issues with PDF viewing**

## How to Fix PDF Viewing Issues

If PDFs are uploaded but not displaying correctly, you need to run the storage permission fixes:

1. Navigate to the Supabase Dashboard for your project
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Open the `fix-storage-permissions.sql` file from this repository
4. Run the SQL commands to:
   - Update storage bucket settings for the 'notes' bucket
   - Add proper CORS headers and public access policies
   - Set appropriate file size limits and allowed mime types

After running these fixes, PDF viewing should work across all browsers using one of the three viewing options provided.

## Manual Testing Steps

1. **Upload a New File**
   - Select Year, Semester, Subject, and Unit
   - Upload a PDF file
   - Submit the form

2. **Check Admin Panel**
   - Navigate to the Admin Panel
   - Verify the file appears in the "Pending Requests" tab
   - Preview the file to ensure it loads correctly
   - Approve the file

3. **Verify Display**
   - Navigate to the Notes Browser
   - Select the same Year/Regulation, Department, and Semester
   - Check that the approved file is visible in the list
   - Open the file and try the different PDF viewing options:
     - Browser Viewer (native)
     - Google Viewer (cross-browser)
     - Direct Link (download)

## Future Improvements

1. Add PDF.js integration for better PDF handling and navigation
2. Implement file thumbnails/previews for documents
3. Add search functionality within PDF documents
4. Enhance filtering options for better discoverability
5. Implement user favorites and recent views for better user experience
